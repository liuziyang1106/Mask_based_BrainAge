# Mask-based Brain Age Estimation Net (MBA Net)

We introduce a Mask-based Brain Age estimation Network (MBA Net) tailored for patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. 
This model aims to alleviate the impact of acute ischemic infarction, enabling more accurate analysis of non-infarcted brain regions and approximating the pre-onset brain state. 
Next, we employ the MBA Net to analyze MRI data from patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, with the derived brain age designated as the Contextual Brain Age (CBA) 


CBA data and MBA Net Code can be accessed for requests from verified academic researchers for noncommercial and scientific research purposes. 
Researchers should sign a license together with completing a data/code access form for their intended study when request the CBA data or MBA Net Code via email to liuziyang1106@buaa.edu.cn. 
Submitted license and data/code access forms will be reviewed by our to verify whether the request is subject to any intellectual property, privacy protection, or confidentiality obligations. For requests from verified academic researchers, access will be granted within one month.
